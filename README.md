This repository contains code and documentation for the solution of QOSF Mentorship Program Cohort 4, Screening task 1. 

The code base consists of a "circuit" module that includes functions to be called, and an "execute" Jupyter notebook that runs the alorithm based on the input. 

Documentation includes, in addition to this README, a pdf report with a detailed explanation of the attempted approach to the task and the final outcomes.
